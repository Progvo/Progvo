# Progvo 0.9-skizo

Progvo is a programming language. Website: https://progvo.dev/

As a project that just started, it is naturally not well specified and will likely change heavily until it becomes advanced enough. A draft documentation is available on the website.

Obviously, many features are missing or only partially implemented, but the long term goal will be to have a simple, versatile and productive programming language.

Progvo-PM is a basic Progvo IDE (editor and interpreter). Read `README_En.md` in its directory for compiling and usage instructions.

The first commit will be force updated once a while until the project becomes stable enough to accept contributions from others.

If you somehow found Progvo and are interested in it, don't hesitate to contact me.

## Ecii encoding

Progvo uses Esperanto for keywords, and more importantly: the Ecii character encoding (Esperanto Code for Information Interchange, Ekio in Esperanto).

Why using a new encoding? Storing and interpreting text in fixed 8 bits characters is easier to do than using for example UTF-8, and ASCII is not adapted for Esperanto language. One could also use Ecii in vintage computer modding or any computer project from scratch using Esperanto.

The Ecii definition is available [here](https://progvo.dev/Ekio.html). Support for existing character encodings may come later.
